# Exercise-7
In this exercise, you'll work with a dataset of **NBA team statistics** from a recent season. Here, you'll practice data wrangling using DPLYR functions while reading in real world data.

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to Github.
