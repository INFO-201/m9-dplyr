# Exercise 7: DPLYR practice with NBA data

# Read in the NBA player data into a variable called `team.data` using `read.csv`


# The data.frame team.data should now be accessible to you.
# View it, and get some basic information about the number of rows/columns.
# Note the "X" preceding some of the column titles as well as the "*"
# following the names of teams that made it to the playoffs that year.


# Add a column that gives the turnovers to steals ratio (TOV / STL) for each team


# Sort the teams from lowest turnover/steal ratio to highest
# Which team has the lowest ratio?


# Using the pipe operator, create a new column of assists per game (AST / G) AND
# sort the data.frame by this new column in DESCENDING order.


# Create a data.frame called `good.offense` of teams that scored more than 8700 points (PTS)


# Create a data.frame called `good.defense` of teams that had more than 470 blocks (BLK)


# Create a data.frame called `defense.stats` that only shows defensive rebounds (DRB), steals (STL),
# and blocks (BLK) along with the team name.


# Create a data.frame called `offense.stats` that only shows offensive rebounds (ORB),
# field-goal % (FG.), and assists (AST) along with the team name.


### Bonus ###
# Create a function called `BetterShooters` that takes in two teams and returns
# a data.frame of the team with the better field-goal percentage. The returned
# data.frame should include the team name, field-goal percentage, and points.
