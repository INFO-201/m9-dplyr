# install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)


# Create a dataframe of the average arrival delay for each destination, then use left_join
# to join on the "airports" dataframe, which has the airport info


# Create a dataframe of the average arrival delay for each airline, then use left_join
# to join on the "airlines" dataframe, which has the airline info
