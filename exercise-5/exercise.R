# Exercise 5: DPLYR Grouped Operations

# Install the `nycflights13` package. Load (`library()`) the package.
# You'll also need to load `dplyr`
#install.packages("nycflights13")  # should be done already
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

# What was the average department delay in each month?
# Save this as a data frame `dep.delay.by.month`
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation before summarizing your data


# Which month had the greatest average departure delay?


# If your above data frame contains the columns "month", and "delay", you can create
# a scatterplot by passing that data frame to the 'plot()' function


# To which destinations were the average arrival delays the highest?
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation before summarizing your data


# You can look up these airports in the `airports` data frame!


### Bonus ###
# Which city was flown to with the highest average speed?
