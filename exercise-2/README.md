# Exercise-2
In this exercise, you'll practice asking questions of a dataset _with_ the use of the `dplyr` library. Note, how much simpler/clearer the same tasks are (from exercise-1) with the use of the library.

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
