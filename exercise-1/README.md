# Exercise-1
In this exercise, you'll practice asking questions of a dataset _without_ the use of the `dplyr` library. Understanding these operations _without_ the use of the library with both help you better understand data frames, and will amplify your appreciation for `dplyr`. 

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
