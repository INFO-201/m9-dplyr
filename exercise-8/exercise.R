#Use "dplyr"
#Install.packages("dplyr")



#Load in SwissData from data set from data folder and view it to understand what is in it.


#Add a column (using dpylr) that is the absolute difference between Education and Examination and call it
# Educated.Score


#Which area(s) had the largest difference


#Find which region has the highest percent of men in agriculture and retunr only the
#percent and region name.  Use pipe operators to accomplish this.


#Find the average of all infant.mortality rates and create a column (Mortality.Difference)
# showing the difference between a regions mortality rate and the mean. Arrange the dataframe in
# Descending order based on this new column. Use pipe operators.


# Create a new data frame that only is that of regions that have a Infant mortality rate less than the
# mean.  Have this data frame only have the regions name, education and mortality rate.


#Filter one of the columns based on a question that you may have (which regions have a higher
#education rate, etc.) and write that to a csv file


# Create a function that can take in two different region names and compare them based on a statistic
# Of your choice (education, Examination, ect.)  print out a statment describing which one is greater
# and return a data frame that holds the selected region and the compared variable.  If your feeling adventurous
# also have your function write to a csv file.
